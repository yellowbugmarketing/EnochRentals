    about: `<p>The constantly evolving industry needs are demanding more skilled developers who are good in writing effective programs with best algorithms and good in problems solving. This is where Data Structures with Algorithms comes into the play.</p>

<p><strong>What is a Data Structure?</strong></p>

<p>A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data. In simple terms &quot;A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively&quot;.</p>

<p>Basic types of Data Structures :&nbsp;Integer, Float, Boolean, Char etc., all are known as Primitive Data Structures.</p>

<p>We also have some complex Data Structures, which are used to store large and connected data. Some example of Abstract Data Structure are</p>

<ul>
	<li>Linked List</li>
	<li>Tree</li>
	<li>Graph</li>
	<li>Stack</li>
	<li>Queue etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is an Algorithm?</strong></p>

<p>An algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem.</p>

<p>An algorithm is a finite set of instructions or logic, written in order, to accomplish a certain predefined task. Algorithm is not the complete code or program, it is just the core logic (solution) of a problem, which can be expressed either as an informal high level description as pseudo code or using a flowchart.</p>

<p>Every Algorithm must satisfy the following properties:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Input- There should be 0 or more inputs supplied externally to the algorithm</li>
	<li>Output- There should be at least 1 output obtained</li>
	<li>Definiteness- Every step of the algorithm should be clear and well defined</li>
	<li>Finiteness- The algorithm should have finite number of steps</li>
	<li>Correctness- Every step of the algorithm must generate a correct output</li>
</ul>

<p>An algorithm is said to be efficient and fast, if it takes less time to execute and consumes less memory space. The performance of an algorithm is measured on the basis of following properties:</p>

<p>Space Complexity:Its the amount of memory space required by the algorithm, during the property of its execution. Space complexity must be taken seriously for multi-user systems and in situations where limited memory is available.</p>

<p>Time Complexity:Time Complexity is a way to represent the amount of time required by the program to run till its completion. It&#39;s generally a good practice to try to keep the time required minimum, so that our algorithm completes its execution in the minimum time possible.</p>

    about: `<p>To understand what a full stack developer first we have to know how the web is structured</p>

<p>There are two major components in application they are</p>

<ol>
	<li>Front End</li>
	<li>Back End</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What is Front End?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The front end of a website (or web or mobile application) is the part a user sees and directly interacts with it.</li>
	<li>Front end developers build the visible parts of websites (like web pages and user interfaces) that users see and interact with.</li>
	<li>Ex: When you open any web application you will see a page with images, menu items, login form etc, that is called as Front End of the application.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Front End programming languages include:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>HTML</li>
	<li>CSS</li>
	<li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is Backend?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Backend development is made from everything that the server does. That means everything that the average user doesn&#39;t see and doesn&#39;t need to know how it&#39;s done. Backend development includes all the logical processes and all the behind the scenes functionalities of web applications. It stores and retrieves data and calculates results.</li>
	<li>Back end developers build the under the hood parts of websites that users dont interact with directly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ex: When you click on Login button with credentials then you will be logged into application if credentials are valid. If credentials are invalid application will display error message. To verify your credentials are valid or invalid some logic will execute in the background that is called as backend development.</p>

<p><strong>Back end programming languages include:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Java</li>
	<li>Python</li>
	<li>PHP</li>
	<li>Ruby on Rails etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is Full stack Development?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Full stack development is the combination of both front end and backend development.</li>
	<li>A full-stack developer is a web developer or engineer who works with both the front end development and back end development of an application.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Skills needed for someone to be considered as a full stack developer</strong></p>

<p>Though there are many skills you need to master to become a full-stack developer, some of the most important ones are listed below.</p>

<ul>
	<li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
	<li>Ideally, one or more third-party library like React or Angular</li>
	<li>Programming languages and libraries like Java, Ruby, PHP and Python</li>
	<li>Experience with databases, like MongoDB, Oracle, SQL and MySQL</li>
	<li>Version control like Git</li>
	<li>Knowledge of security concerns and best practices</li>
	<li>Ideally, some knowledge of web or visual design, plus user experience best practices</li>
	<li>Full Stack Developer Responsibilities</li>
	<li>Developing front end website architecture</li>
	<li>Designing user interactions on web pages</li>
	<li>Developing back end website applications</li>
	<li>Creating servers and databases for functionality</li>
	<li>Ensuring cross-platform optimization for mobile phones</li>
	<li>Ensuring responsiveness of applications</li>
	<li>Designing and developing APIs</li>
	<li>Meeting both technical and consumer needs</li>
	<li>Application deployment using DevOps tools</li>
</ul>
